# Shop Easy
## Problem Statement:
In many instances people end up spending lot of time in searching for an item they need. Whether it may be grocery store, medical store or a clothing retail store. It’s not easy to find the aisle or the section where the required item is in.

## Solution:
	Stores will use Shop Easy app to store different items along with their aisle number, rack number / section name / description or a photo of map to locate the item. Saving this data will be made easy by scanning the barcodes on racks and the item.
	Customers will use the app lo search for the item and quickly locate the location in the store.

## Technologies:
•	Firebase Gmail authentication for creating store
•	Scandit to scan QR or Bar codes
•	React to create UI components
•	Materialize and Semantic-ui as CSS framework
•	MongoDB as data store
•	Mongoose ORM to interact with DB
•	Express server
•	Heroku to host the application
